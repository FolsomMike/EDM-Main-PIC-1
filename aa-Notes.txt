01_EDM_Main-PIC-2

This is the assembler file created from the reverse engineered version pulled from the original board.

It may have modifications added after the reverse-engineering.

It was not originally tracked in Git until after the new code had been used for some time.

It should only be used on the original boards with the manual pots.

That board only had the Main PIC and the LCD PIC and used bit-banging for serial communication between the two.

It should work with the 02_EDM-LCD-PIC-2 file if it becomes necessary to reprogram an old board. Otherwise,
one of the raw hex files pulled from an original PIC in the root folder should work.
